# MIT-BIH ECG Classification

This repository contains the code and trained model for classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using a deep learning approach. The project leverages the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/) and PyTorch to build a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated arrhythmia detection.

## üìù Project Description

This project aims to automate the classification of ECG signals to help with the detection of cardiac arrhythmias.  
Using the MIT-BIH dataset, we preprocess the ECG recordings, segment the signals, and train a 1D CNN to distinguish between different heartbeat classes (e.g., Normal vs. Abnormal). The model is evaluated on standard metrics such as accuracy and F1-score. All code is provided in a Jupyter notebook for easy reproducibility.
